        Since the age of 9, I was drawn to computers and technology in general. As the years passed, I
        became
        very
        proficient using computers, particularly my Macintosh Performa 635. Before long, I began to wonder
        how
        it
        all works. With that curiosity, I found myself completely disassembling my computer and miraculously
        putting
        it all back together with no help at all. YouTube University wasn’t around back then. After many
        more
        years
        of self-educating myself on the basics of Information Technology, I landed my first IT job as a
        Technical
        Support Specialist at Philips. With so much exposure to technology and vital company systems, I knew
        that I
        needed to expand my technical knowledge through formal education. After reading about the Coding
        Boot
        Camp,
        I knew this would be the opportunity I’ve been waiting for to help me connect the many “technical
        dots”
        that
        I have collected over the years.
